# magic-square
In recreational mathematics and combinatorial design, a magic square is a square grid (where n is the number of cells on each side) filled with distinct positive integers in the range. such that each cell contains a different integer and the sum of the integers in each row, column and diagonal is equal.
In this algorithm you can create magic square of the order of odd numbers.
